      <h2>Carboniferous</h2>
      <p>This project was a response to the geology archive at Wolverhampton Art Gallery, looking specifically at the coal fossils from the Black Country in collaboration with geologist Chris Broughton. The work was made during a residency at Wolverhampton University and some pieces were included in <a href="http://www.wolverhamptonart.org.uk/whats-on/riches-beneath-us/">‘The Riches Beneath Us’</a> exhibition at Bilston Craft Gallery, and ‘Temporal Permanence’ at Wolverhampton Art Gallery.</p>
