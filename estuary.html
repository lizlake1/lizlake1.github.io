      <p>An installation at Tilbury Cruise Terminal as part of the inaugural Estuary Festival, curated by <a href="http://www.metalculture.com/">Metal</a>.</p>

      <p>“In the work of artist Liz Lake, found flotsam and jetsam are cast into concrete and sliced to reveal an invented geology with strata of landfill, concrete, aggregate and ash. <i>A River Once Ran Through My Veins</i> is an installation in a former Port of London Authority office at Tilbury Cruise Terminal which imagines a future where the estuary landscape has long since been swallowed by silt.”</p>
