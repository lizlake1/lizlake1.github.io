    <h2>Endnote</h2>

    <p>
      Endnote is an artwork made in response to the novel Shifts by Christopher Meredith. The book is set in 1977 in Ebbw Vale
      steel mill, and documents the demise of steel production and the onset of the electrolytic tin-plating process. Endnote combines
      digitally altered archival imagery from Ebbw Vale Works Museum Archive (depicting the last ton of steel poured), with tin-plated
      cast objects, enamel paint and steel. The piece was commissioned by Cardiff University for Literary Atlas project, and will
      be exhibited at numerous venues across Wales, including Oriel Davis Gallery and The National Library of Wales.
